    <H1>2.3 &nbsp; Quicksort</H1>
    <p><br>
    
    Quicksort is popular because it is not difficult to implement, 
    works well for a variety of different kinds of input data, and is substantially faster than 
    any other sorting method in typical applications.
    It is in-place (uses only a small auxiliary stack), requires time
    proportional to N log N on the average to sort N items,
    and has an extremely short inner loop.
    
    <p><h2>The basic algorithm.</h2>
    Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer method for sorting. It 
    works by <em>partitioning</em> an array into two parts,
    then sorting the parts independently. 
    
    <p><center>
    <IMG SRC="images/quicksort-overview.png" alt = "Quicksort overview">
    </center>
    
    The crux of the method is the partitioning process, which rearranges the array 
    to make the following three conditions hold: 
    
    <ul>
    <p><li> The entry <tt>a[j]</tt> is in its final place in the array, for some <tt>j</tt>.
    <p><li> No entry in <tt>a[lo]</tt> through <tt>a[j-1]</tt> is greater than <tt>a[j]</tt>.
    <p><li> No entry in <tt>a[j+1]</tt> through <tt>a[hi]</tt> is less than <tt>a[j]</tt>.
    </ul>
    
    We achieve a complete sort by partitioning,
    then recursively applying the method to
    the subarrays.
    It is a <em>randomized</em> algorithm, because it 
    randomly shuffles the array before sorting it.
    
    <p><h3>Partitioning.</h3>
    To complete the implementation, we need to implement the partitioning method. We use 
    the following general strategy: First, we arbitrarily 
    choose <tt>a[lo]</tt> to be the partitioning item&mdash;the one that will go into
    its final position. Next, we 
    scan from the left end of the array until we find an 
    entry that is greater than (or equal to) the partitioning item,
    and we scan from the right 
    end of the array until we find an entry less than (or equal to) the partitioning
    item. 
    
    <p><center>
    <IMG SRC="images/partitioning-overview.png" alt = "Quicksort partitioning overview">
    </center>
    
    The two items that stopped the scans are out of place in the final partitioned 
    array, so we exchange them.
    When the scan 
    indices cross, all that we need to do to complete the partitioning process is to exchange 
    the partitioning item
    <tt>a[lo]</tt> with the rightmost entry of the left subarray
    (<tt>a[j]</tt>) and return its index <tt>j</tt>.

    <p><h3>Quicksort.</h3>
    <a href = "Quick.java.html">Quick.java</a> is an implementation
    of quicksort, using the partitioning method described above.

    <p><h3>Implementation details.</h3>
    There are several subtle issues with respect to implementing quicksort that are 
    reflected in this code and worthy of mention.
    
    <ul>
    <li><em>Partitioning inplace.</em> If we use an extra array,
    partitioning is easy to implement, but not so much easier
    that it is worth the extra cost of copying the partitioned
    version back into the original.
    
    <li><em>Staying in bounds.</em>
    If the smallest item or the largest item in the array is
    the partitioning item, we have to take care that the 
    pointers do not run off the left or right ends of the array,
    respectively.
    
    
    <li><em>Preserving randomness.</em>
    The random shuffle puts the array in random order. 
    Since it treats all items in the subarrays uniformly,
    <a href = "Quick.java.html">Quick.java</a>
    has the property that its two subarrays are
    also in random order. This fact is crucial to the
    algorithm's predictability.
    An alternate way to preserve randomness is to choose a random
    item for partitioning within <tt>partition()</tt>.
    
    <li><em>Terminating the loop.</em>
    Properly testing whether the pointers have crossed is a bit
    trickier than it might seem at first glance.
    A common error is to fail to take into account that the array might 
    contain other keys with the same value as the partitioning item.
    
    <li><em>Handling items with keys equal to the partitioning item's key.</em>
    It is best to stop the left scan for items with keys greater than
    <em>or equal to</em> the partitioning item's key and the 
    right scan for items less than <em>or equal to</em>
    the partitioning item's key. Even though this policy might seem to
    create unnecessary exchanges involving items with keys equal to the 
    partitioning item's key, it is crucial to avoiding
    quadratic running time in certain typical applications.
    
    <li><em>Terminating the recursion.</em>
    A common mistake in implementing quicksort involves not 
    ensuring that one item is always put into position,
    then falling into an infinite recursive loop when the
    partitioning item happens to be the largest or smallest item
    in the array. 
    
    </ul>
    
    
    <!--
    <p><h3>Performance characteristics.</h3>
    The best case for quicksort is when each partitioning stage
    divides the array exactly in half. This circumstance
    would make the number of compares used by 
    quicksort satisfy the divide-and-conquer recurrence
    C(N) = 2 C(N/2) + N, which has the solution C(N) ~ N lg N.
    Although things do not always go this well, it is true that
    the partition falls in the middle 
    on the average. 
    -->
    
    <p><h3>Proposition.</h3> Quicksort uses 
    ~2 N ln N compares
    (and one-sixth that many exchanges) on the average to
    sort an array of length N with distinct keys.
    
    <p><h3>Proposition.</h3> Quicksort uses ~N<sup>2</sup>/2 compares
    in the worst case, but random shuffling protects against this
    case.
    
    <p>
    The standard deviation of the running time
    is about .65 N, so the running time tends to the average as
    N grows and is unlikely to be far from the average.
    The probability that quicksort will use a quadratic number of
    compares when sorting a large 
    array on your computer is much less than the probability that your
    computer will be struck by lightning!
    
    
    <p><h3>Improvements.</h3>
    Quicksort was invented in 1960 by C. A. R. Hoare, and it has been studied
    and refined by many people since that time.
    
    <ul>
    <li><em>Cutoff to insertion sort.</em>
    As with mergesort, it pays to switch to insertion sort for tiny arrays.
    The optimum value of the cutoff is system-dependent, but any 
    value between 5 and 15 is likely to work well in most situations. 
    
    <li><em>Median-of-three partitioning.</em>
    A second easy way to improve the performance of quicksort is to use the 
    median of a small sample of items taken from the array as the 
    partitioning item. Doing so will give a slightly better partition, but at
    the cost of computing the median. It turns out that most of the available
    improvement comes from choosing a sample of size 3 (and then partitioning
    on the middle item).
    
    </ul>

    <p><h2>Entropy-optimal sorting.</h2>
    Arrays with large numbers of duplicate sort keys arise
    frequently in applications.
    In such applications, there is potential to
    reduce the time of the sort from linearithmic to linear.
    <p>
    
    One straightforward idea is to partition the array into three parts,
    one each for items with keys smaller than, equal to, and larger than the
    partitioning item's key. Accomplishing 
    this partitioning was a classical programming exercise 
    popularized by E. W. Dijkstra as the <em>Dutch National 
    Flag problem</em>, because it is like sorting an array with three 
    possible key values, which might correspond to the three 
    colors on the flag. 
    
    <p>
    Dijkstra's solution is based on a single left-to-right  
    pass through the array that maintains a pointer <tt>lt</tt> such 
    that <tt>a[lo..lt-1]</tt> is less than <tt>v</tt>,
    a pointer <tt>gt</tt> such that <tt>a[gt+1..hi]</tt> is greater than <tt>v</tt>,
    and a pointer <tt>i</tt> such that <tt>a[lt..i-1]</tt> are
    equal to v, and <tt>a[i..gt]</tt> are not yet examined.

    </center>
    
    <p>
    Starting with <tt>i</tt> equal to <tt>lo</tt>
    we process <tt>a[i]</tt> using the 3-way compare
    given us by the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface
    to handle the three possible cases: 
    <ul>
    <p><li> <tt>a[i]</tt> less than <tt>v</tt>:
    exchange <tt>a[lt]</tt> with <tt>a[i]</tt> and increment both <tt>lt</tt>
    and <tt>i</tt> 
    
    <p><li> <tt>a[i]</tt> greater than <tt>v</tt>:
    exchange <tt>a[i]</tt> with <tt>a[gt]</tt> and decrement <tt>gt</tt>
    
    <p><li> <tt>a[i]</tt> equal to <tt>v</tt>: increment <tt>i</tt>
