    <H1>4.2 &nbsp; Directed Graphs</H1>
    <p><br>
    
    <h2>Digraphs.</h2>
    A <em>directed graph</em> (or <em>digraph</em>)
    is a set of <em>vertices</em> and a collection
    of <em>directed edges</em> that each connects an ordered pair of vertices.
    We say that a directed edge <em>points from</em> the first vertex in the
    pair and <em>points to</em> the second vertex in the pair.
    We use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph.
    
    <p>
    <center>
    <img src = "images/digraph.png" alt = "Digraph">
    </center>
    <p>
    <br>
    
    <p><h2>Glossary.</h2>
    Here are some definitions that we use.
    <ul>
    
    <li> 
    A <em>self-loop</em> is an edge that connects a vertex to
    itself.
    
    <li>
    Two edges are <em>parallel</em> if they connect the same ordered pair of
    vertices.
    
    <!--
    <li>
    When an edge connects two vertices, we say that the vertices are
    <em>adjacent to</em> one another and that the edge is 
    <em>incident on</em> both vertices.
    -->
    
    <li>
    The <em>outdegree</em> of a vertex is the number of edges pointing from it.
    
    <li>
    The <em>indegree</em> of a vertex is the number of edges pointing to it.
    
    <li>
    A <em>subgraph</em> is a subset of a digraph's edges (and associated
    vertices) that constitutes a digraph.
    
    <li>
    A <em>directed path</em> in a digraph is a sequence
    of vertices in which there is a (directed) edge
    pointing from each vertex in the sequence to its successor in the sequence,
    with no repeated edges.
    
    <li>
    A directed path is <em>simple</em> if it has no repeated vertices.
    
    <li>
    A <em>directed cycle</em> is a directed path (with at least one edge) 
    whose first and last vertices are the same.
    
    <li>
    A directed cycle is <em>simple</em> if it has no repeated vertices
    (other than the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices).
    
    <li>
    The <em>length</em> of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.
    
    <li>
    We say that a vertex <tt>w</tt> is <em>reachable from</em> a vertex <tt>v</tt>
    if there exists a directed path from <tt>v</tt> to <tt>w</tt>.
    
    <li>
    We say that two vertices <tt>v</tt> and <tt>w</tt> are <em>strongly connected</em>
    if they are mutually reachable: there is a directed path from <tt>v</tt> to <tt>w</tt>
    and a directed path from <tt>w</tt> to <tt>v</tt>.
    
    <li>
    A digraph is <em>strongly connected</em> if there is a directed path from
    every vertex to every other vertex.
    
    <li>
    A digraph that is not strongly connected consists of a set of
    <em>strongly connected components</em>, which are maximal strongly connected
    subgraphs.
    
    <li>
    A <em>directed acyclic graph</em> (or DAG) is a digraph with no 
    directed cycles.

    <p><h2>Digraph graph data type.</h2>
    We implement the following digraph API.

    <IMG SRC="images/digraph-api.png" alt = "Digraph API">
    </center>
    
    <p>
    The key method <tt>adj()</tt> allows client code
    to iterate through the vertices adjacent from a given vertex. 
    
    <p>
    We prepare the test data 
    <a href = "tinyDG.txt">tinyDG.txt</a>
    using the following input file format.

    </center>
    
    
    
    <p><h2>Graph representation.</h2>
    We use the <em>adjacency-lists representation</em>, where we maintain
    a vertex-indexed array of lists of the vertices connected by an edge
    to each vertex.

    <p><h2>Reachability in digraphs.</h2>
    Depth-first search and breadth-first search are fundamentally digraph-processing
    algorithms.
    
    <ul>
    <p><li> <em>Single-source reachability:</em>
    Given a digraph and source <tt>s</tt>, is there a directed path from 
    s to v? If so, find such a path.
    <a href = "DirectedDFS.java.html">DirectedDFS.java</a>
    uses depth-first search to solve this problem.
    
    <p><li> <em>Multiple-source reachability:</em>
    Given a digraph and a <em>set</em> of source vertices,
    is there a directed path from <em>any</em> vertex in the set
    to v?
    <a href = "DirectedDFS.java.html">DirectedDFS.java</a>
    uses depth-first search to solve this problem.
    
    <p><li><em>Single-source directed paths:</em> given a digraph and source
    <tt>s</tt>, is there a directed path from s to v? If so, find such a path.
    <a href = "DepthFirstDirectedPaths.java.html">DepthFirstDirectedPaths.java</a>
    uses depth-first search to solve this problem.
    
    <p><li><em>Single-source shortest directed paths</em>: given a digraph and source
    <tt>s</tt>, is there a directed path from 
    s to v? If so, find a shortest such path.
    <a href = "BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java.html">BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java</a>
    uses breadth-first search to solve this problem.
    
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p><h2>Cycles and DAGs.</h2>
    Directed cycles are of particular importance in applications that
    involve processing digraphs.
    
    The input file
    <a href = "tinyDAG.txt">tinyDAG.txt</a>
    corresponds to the following DAG:

    <!--
    For example, consider a college student planning a 
    course schedule, under the constraint that certain courses are prerequisite
    for certain other courses.
    If we further assume that the student can take only one course at a time, we have an
    instance of the
    <em>Precedence-constrained scheduling problem</em>:
    Given a set of jobs to be completed,
    with precedence constraints that specify that certain jobs have to be
    completed before certain other jobs are begun,
    how can we schedule the jobs such that they are all
    completed while still respecting the constraints?
    -->
    
    <ul>
    
    <p><li><em>Directed cycle detection</em>: does a given digraph have a directed
    cycle? If so, find such a cycle.
    <a href = "DirectedCycle.java.html">DirectedCycle.java</a>
    solves this problem using depth-first search.
    
    <p><li><em>Depth-first orders</em>: 
    Depth-first search search visits each vertex exactly once. 
    Three vertex orderings are of interest in typical applications:
    <ul>
    <p><li><em>Preorder</em>: Put the vertex on a queue before the recursive calls.
    <p><li><em>Postorder</em>: Put the vertex on a queue after the recursive calls.
    <p><li><em>Reverse postorder</em>: Put the vertex on a stack after the recursive calls.
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    <a href = "DepthFirstOrder.java.html">DepthFirstOrder.java</a> computes these
    orders.
    
    <p>
    <center>
    <img src = "images/depth-first-orders.png" alt = "Preorder, postorder, and reverse postorder">
    </center>
    
    <p><li><em>Topological sort</em>: given a digraph, put the vertices in order
    such that all its directed edges point from a vertex earlier in the order to a
    vertex later in the order (or report that doing so is not possible).
    <a href = "Topological.java.html">Topological.java</a> solves this problem
    using depth-first search. Remarkably, a reverse postorder in a DAG provides 
    a topological order.
    
    <p>

    <img src = "images/topological-sort.png" alt = "Topologial sort">
    </center>
    <p>
    <br>
    
    </ul>
    
    
    <p><h3>Proposition.</h3>
    A digraph has a topological order if and only if it is a DAG.
    
    <p><h3>Proposition.</h3>
    Reverse postorder in a DAG is a topological sort.
    
    <p><h3>Proposition.</h3>
    With depth-first search, we can topologically sort a DAG in time proportional
    to V + E.
    
    <p><h2>Strong connectivity.</h2>
    Strong connectivity is an equivalence relation on the set of vertices:
    <ul>
    <p><li><em>Reflexive</em>: Every vertex v is strongly connected to itself.
    <p><li><em>Symmetric</em>: If v is strongly connected to w, then w is
    strongly connected to v.
    <p><li><em>Transitive</em>: If v is strongly connected to w and w
    is strongly connected to x, then v is also strongly connected to x.
    </ul>
    
    Strong connectivity partitions the vertices into equivalence classes,
    which we refer to as <em>strong components</em> for short.
    We seek to implement the following API:
    
    <p>
    <center>
    <IMG SRC="images/scc-api.png" alt = "API for strong components">
    </center>
    
    
    <p>
    Remarkably, <a href = "KosarajuSharirSCC.java.html">KosarajuSharirSCC.java</a> implements
    the API with just a few lines of code added to
    <a href = "../41graph/CC.java.html">CC.java</a>, as follows:
    
    <ul>
    <p><li>Given a digraph G, use <a href = "DepthFirstOrder.java.html">DepthFirstOrder.java</a>
    to compute the reverse postorder of its reverse, G<sup>R</sup>.
    
    <p><li>Run standard DFS on G, but consider the unmarked vertices
    in the order just computed instead of the standard numerical order.
    
    <p><li>
    All vertices reached on a call to the recursive <tt>dfs()</tt>
    from the constructor are in a strong component (!), so identify them as in CC.
    
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Proposition.</h3> The Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm uses
    preprocessing time and space proportional to V + E to support
    constant-time strong connectivity queries in a digraph.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><h2>Transitive closure.</h2>
    The <em>transitive closure</em> of a digraph G is another digraph
    with the same set of vertices, but with an edge from v to w 
    if and only if w is reachable from v in G.
    
    <p>
    <center>
    <img src = "images/transitive-closure.png" alt = "Transitive closure">
    </center>
    <p>
    <br>
    
    <a href = "TransitiveClosure.java.html">TransitiveClosure.java</a> computes the
    transitive closure of a digraph by running depth-first search
    from each vertex and storing the results.
    This solution is ideal for small or dense digraphs,
    but it is not a solution for the large digraphs we might encounter
    in practice because the constructor uses space proportional to V^2
    and time proportional to V (V + E).
